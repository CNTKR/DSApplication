Datastructure: Any structure that holds the data and exibhits some behavoiur are called as datastrucure.                                           
Eg:-                                                                                                                                      
ARRAY                                                                                
STACK                                                                                                   
QUEUE                                                                                                                          
CIRCULARQUEUE                                                                                           
SINGLY LINKEDLIST                                                                                                                 
DOUBLY LINKEDLIST  etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     


Once the application is opened by the user this is how the home page of application looks like, this application perfoams all the operations of particular datastructures which are present on the home screen. Users can access the required application page by clicking on the buttons which are visible on the home screen it takes the user to the actual page to perform actions, using the below link provided link users can also download and run the application.

ARRAY: An array is also a data structure that holds the data and exhibits the behavior(Random insertion and Random deletion).

STACK: A stack is also a data structure that holds the data and exhibits the behavior. (LIFO/Last in First Out)/(FILO/First in last out)

QUEUE: Queue is also a data structure that holds the data and exhibits the behavior.(FIFO/first in first out)/(LILO/last in last out)

CIRCULAR QUEUE: Circular queue is also a data structure that holds the data and exhibits the behavior. (FIFO/first in first out)/(LILO/last in last out)

SINGLY LINKEDLIST: It is also a data structure that holds the data and exhibits the behavior.                                                                                 

Note:-The array data structure has a disadvantage that needs continuous chunk of memory location to store the data to overcome this disadvantage linked list was invented.
       The advantage of linked list is it does not need continuous chunk of memory locations. It contains many nodes or lists linked to each other to store the data. Each            node contains data part and the link part, the data part stores the data and the link part stores the address of next link.

DOUBLY LINKEDLIST: It is also a data structure that holds the data and exhibits the behavior.
